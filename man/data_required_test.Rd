\title{TEST VERSION
Input to model calculation. One row per required data pack column (from DATIM).
Includes parameters (dimensions, items) for calling the indicators, and the key to 
dimension_items_sets for mapping to category options for output.}
\format{A data frame with these variables:
\describe{
  \item{data_pack_sheet}{Datapack Excel sheet label - from datapack schems}
  \item{data_pack_code}{given identifier to map output to a specific column in datapack - from
  datapack schema}
  \item{type}{numeric or percent - if percent then values recieved from DATIM will be 
  divided by 100 - from datapack schema}
  \item{full_formula}{specification for required calculation/output - from datapack schema}
  \item{allocate}{determines how dimension that splits to multiple category options will be 
  handled. If distribute the value returned by analytics will be multiplied by the weight from 
  corresponding entry in dim_item_sets. Replicate means the value is copied and NA means 
  there are no dimensions in the indicator call.
  
  Note: when data are distributed it is sometimes the case that we receive results for a 
  category option from more than one dimension (e.g. age 1-4 data can result from analytics 
  dimension <5 and 1-9): These “duplicates” are added together in the code. This should not 
  happen in the case of replicate and the program will throw an error if duplicate category 
  options result from the indicator call.}

  dimension used when calling the datim indicator. Currently on one dimension item is

\description{
Each data pack output can be the result of combining up to two DATIM indicators into a 
combining calculation. The indicators are designated A and B and the calculation combining 
them is in the calculation column.
