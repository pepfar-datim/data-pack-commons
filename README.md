## How to use this repo

The data-pack-commons repo is utilized by the datapack team each pre-cop season as needed to incorporate changes and produce datapack and psnuxim model files used in the generation of datapack (TST) tools for country teams. Models are then updated regularly as data is imported to reflect new available information on different indicators.

For instructions on use, reference the following [vignette](https://github.com/pepfar-datim/data-pack-commons/blob/master/vignettes/DataPackCommonsTechnicalNotes.Rmd) which shows how to update configuration files for results and targets based work.

## Automated Reporting

During the COP season, datapack/psnuxim models are produced regularly via automated rmarkdown reports published to rstudio connect server in order to account for regular imports. These reports are available to authorized users at the following links:
